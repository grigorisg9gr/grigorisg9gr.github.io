<p>Welcome to my site. My name is Grigoris and I am an Assistant Professor in University of Wisconsin-Madison. </p>

<p>My research focuses on reliable machine learning, focusing on the development of robust models that perform well under noise and out-of-distribution data. Concretely,<p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Parsimonious learning</strong>: Natural signals, like text and images, inherently possess structures often manifested as low-rank or sparse constraints. These constraints are crucial for comprehending the success of modern networks. My immediate objective is to is to understand the inductive bias and properties of existing architectures through empirical and theoretical studies. I aim to achieve a comprehensive theoretical understanding of neural and polynomial networks, including their expressivity, trainability, generalization properties, and inductive biases.</li>

    <li><strong>Trustworthy models</strong>: My goal is to understand the enhance the performance of existing networks, particularly with respect to their extrapolation abilities, and their robustness to malicious (adversarial) attacks. Our recent work focuses on adversarial attacks and defenses in the text domain. Our long-term goal is to develop models that are robust, privacy-preserving, and capable of generalizing well to unseen combinations with strong extrapolation abilities. </li>
</ul>
