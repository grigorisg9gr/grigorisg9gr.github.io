<h1>Ph.D. candidates</h1>
<p>I am actively looking for exceptional Ph.D. candidates interested in the field of Machine Learning (ML).  We're seeking passionate individuals with a strong technical foundation, backed by <strong>solid math and coding skills</strong>, who are interested in <strong>leading cutting-edge projects</strong> in ML. If you're enthusiastic, forward-thinking, and eager to pioneer innovations in the field, you're the perfect candidate we want to hear from.</p>

<p><strong>Application</strong>: The UW Madison ECE/CS departments centrally manage PhD applications following the standard procedure outlined <a href="https://grad.wisc.edu/academic-programs/">here</a>. All candidates are expected to follow the detailed guidelines provided and thoroughly review these procedures as they outline the administrative requirements and academic expectations in depth.

<p>Candidates with a foundation in mathematics and an analytical mindset are well aligned with my research priorities. Our recent work provides insights into the research directions we are pursuing. Although the volume of applications is high and I may not be able to respond to every inquiry individually, please be assured that every submission will be evaluated during our rigorous and inclusive review process.</p>


<h1>BSc students</h1>
<p>I frequently engage in research collaborations with both BSc and MSc students. Given the considerable volume of project inquiries I receive, I strongly encourage you to first review the detailed blog posts, available on my website. These posts provide comprehensive insights into current research initiatives and set clear expectations for potential collaborations.</p>
